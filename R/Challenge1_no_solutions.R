# 
# You want to get public data about COVID-19 
# infections and deaths but 
# you want to focus on what happened in 
# Midwestern states in April


# Consider what libraries you need to get the data,
# filter the data, and visualize the data
# Go for it!



# library loading 
# what libraries might you use for getting the data?
# for reading and filtering the data?
# for plotting the data?

# you can find the data table here:

# https://covid19-lake.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/enigma-nytimes-data-in-usa/csv/us_states/us_states.csv", "Data/us_covid.csv


# define the midwestern states


# read the data, filter, and plot
# how simple can you make the code to get it 
# done?


# read in the data
