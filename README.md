## R-Learning for the HMI3 Research Group

Welcome to the R-Learning repository for the HMI3 Research Group. Here you will find step by step scripts as we navigate through R.

## To Start

You will need two things to begin:

1) R (https://www.r-project.org/)
2) RStudio (https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

You can install the latest versions on your computer. 

At a later point, we will discuss running code on the Northwestern Quest nodes.
