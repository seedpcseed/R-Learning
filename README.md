# R-Learning for the HMI3 Research Group

Welcome to the R-Learning repository for the HMI3 Research Group. Here you will find step by step scripts as we navigate through R.

## To Start

You will need two things to begin:

1) R (https://www.r-project.org/)
2) RStudio (https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

You can install the latest versions on your computer. 

At a later point, we will discuss running code on the Northwestern Quest nodes.

## The Lessons

### Lesson 1

Here we will go very slow and learn about the R Studio environment.

- Tour of the environment
- Examine the directory and file explorer
- Load some data from a file and the web
- Plot some data

### Lesson 2

- Review Lesson 1 key points
- Look at Lesson 1 in markdown language
- Explore data.frames and matricies
- Talk about factors
- Subset and filter data
- Take a first look at functions
